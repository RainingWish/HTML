Differences Between SVG and Canvas

SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. 
You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. 
If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. 
If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, 
including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.




Canvas									SVG
Resolution dependent						Resolution independent
No support for event handlers					Support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities				Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg		Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Well suited for graphic-intensive games				Not suited for game applications
