HTML Headings

Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on

Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold



Bigger Headings

Each HTML heading has a default size.
However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute,
using the CSS font-size property
