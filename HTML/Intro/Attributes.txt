HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


The href Attribute

HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute

REF: EX2



The src Attribute

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute

The width and height Attributes

HTML images also have width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image

REF: EX2

Note:The width and height are specified in pixels by default; so width="500" means 500 pixels wide


The alt Attribute

The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, if an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the alt attribute can be read by screen readers. 
This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a vision impaired person, can "hear" the element.

REF:EX3

Note: The alt attribute is also useful if the image cannot be displayed

The lang Attribute

The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.

The language is declared with the lang attribute.

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines

REF: EX3


The title Attribute

Here, a title attribute is added to the <p> element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph
